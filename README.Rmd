The goal of __fgeo.biomass__ is to calculate biomass using best available allometric-equations from the [__allodb__](https://forestgeo.github.io/allodb/) package. 

## Warning

This package is not ready for research. We are now building a [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), with just enough features to collect feedback from alpha users and redirect our effort. The resulting biomass is still meaningless. For a working product see the [BIOMASS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BIOMASS) package.

## Installation

Install the development version of **fgeo.biomass** with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.biomass")
```
## Example

In addition to the fgeo.biomass package we will use dplyr and ggplot2 for data wrangling and plotting.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(fgeo.biomass)
```

We'll use the `add_biomass()` with these inputs:

1. A ForestGEO-like _stem_ or _tree_ table.
2. A _species_ table (internally used to look up the Latin species names from the species codes in the `sp` column of the census table).

We'll use data from the [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute) (SCBI). We first pick alive trees and drop missing `dbh` values as we can't calculate biomass for them.

```{r}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1 %>% 
  filter(status == "A", !is.na(dbh))

census
```

We now use `add_biomass()` to add biomass to our census dataset. 

```{r}
species <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_species

with_biomass <- census %>% 
  add_biomass(species, site = "SCBI")
```

We are warned that we are using a tree-table (as opposed to a stem-table), and informed about how to interpret the resulting `biomass` values for trees and shrubs.

Some equations couldn't be found. There may be two reasons:

* Some stems in the data belong to species with no matching species in allodb.
* Some stems in the data belong to species that do match species in allodb but the available equations were designed for a dbh range that doesn't include actual dbh values in the data.

Here are the most interesting columns of the result:

```{r}
with_biomass %>% 
  select(treeID, species, biomass)
```

Let's now visualize the relationship between `dbh` and b`biomass` by `species` (black points), in comparison with `agb` (above ground biomass) values calculated with allometric equations for tropical trees (grey points). 

```{r, fig.height=14}
with_biomass %>% 
  # Convert agb from [Mg] to [kg]
  mutate(agb_kg = agb * 1e3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dbh)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = agb_kg), size = 1.5, color = "grey") +
  geom_point(aes(y = biomass), size = 1, color = "black") +
  facet_wrap("species", ncol = 4) +
  ylab("Reference `agb` (grey) and calculated `biomass` (black) in [kg]") +
  xlab("dbh [mm]") +
  theme_bw()
```

Above, the species for which `biomass` couldn't be calculated show no black points, although they do show grey reference-points.

To better understand the distribution of `biomass` values for each species we can use a box-plot.

```{r}
with_biomass %>% 
  ggplot(aes(species, biomass)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(species, agb), color = "grey") +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("biomass [kg]") +
  coord_flip()
```
