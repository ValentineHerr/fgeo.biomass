The goal of __fgeo.biomass__ is to calculate biomass using best available allometric-equations from the [__allodb__](https://forestgeo.github.io/allodb/) package. 

## Warning

This package is not ready for research. We are now building a [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), with just enough features to collect feedback from alpha users and redirect our effort. The resulting biomass is still meaningless. For a working product see the [BIOMASS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BIOMASS) package.

## Installation

Install the development version of **fgeo.biomass** with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo.biomass")
```
## Example

In addition to __fgeo.biomass__, here we will use some other general purpose packages for manipulating data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fgeo.biomass)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

As an example, we will use census and species datasets from the ForestGEO plot at the [Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute](https://forestgeo.si.edu/sites/north-america/smithsonian-conservation-biology-institute) (SCBI).

```{r}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1

census
```

To match the census data with the best available allometric-equations we need (a) the name of the ForestGEO site (here "scbi"), and (b) each species' Latin name. But instead of Latin names, ForestGEO's _census_ tables record species codes.

```{r}
# To search for specific columns in the datasets
sp_or_latin <- "^sp$|^Latin$"

census %>% 
  select(matches(sp_or_latin))
```

The species' Latin names are recorded in _species_ tables.

```{r}
species <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_species

species %>% 
  select(matches(sp_or_latin))
```

We can then add species' Latin names to the census data by joining the _census_ and _species_ tables. We may do that with `dplyr::left_join()` but `fgeo.biomass::add_species()` is more specialized.

```{r}
census_species <- census %>%
  add_species(species, "scbi")

census_species %>% 
  select(matches(sp_or_latin))
```

### Finding the best available allometric-equations

Before we added the Latin name of each species to the census data into the `sp` column. Now we want to find the best available allometric-equations for as many rows as possible with `allo_find()`. We may not have allometric equations form all species. Although the code will eventually fall back to more general equations, for now we just drop the rows that don't match the available species for the specified site.

```{r}
equations <- census_species %>% 
  allo_find()

equations
```

If you need more information about each equation, `allo_lookup()` helps you to look it up in __allodb__.

```{r}
equations %>% 
  allo_lookup(allodb::master())
```

### Calculating biomass

For the rows for which an equation was found in __allodb__, we can now calculate biomass. `allo_evaluate()` evaluates each allometric equation by replacing the literal string "dbh" with the corresponding value for each row in the `dbh` column, then doing the actual computation and storing the result in the the new `biomass` column.

```{r}
with_biomass <- equations %>% 
  allo_evaluate()

with_biomass %>% 
  select(eqn, dbh, biomass)
```

Commonly we would further summarize the result. For that you can use the __dplyr__ package or any general purpose tool. For example, this summary gives the total biomass for each species in descending order.

```{r}
with_biomass %>% 
  group_by(sp) %>% 
  summarize(total_biomass = sum(biomass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_biomass))
```

### Providing custom equations

If we have our own equations, we can create an `equations`-like dataset and use it. `as_eqn()` helps us to create such a dataset: It ensures that our data has the correct structure.

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Checks that the structure of your data isn't terriby wrong
# BAD
as_eqn("really bad data")
as_eqn(data.frame(1))

# GOOD
custom_equations <- tibble::tibble(
  equation_id = c("000001"),
  site = c("scbi"),
  sp = c("paulownia tomentosa"),
  eqn = c("exp(-2.48 + 2.4835 * log(dbh))"),
  eqn_type = c("mixed_hardwood"),
  anatomic_relevance = c("total aboveground biomass")
)

class(as_eqn(custom_equations))
```

We can now use the argument `custom_eqn` to pass our custom equations to `allo_find()`.

```{r}
allo_find(census_species, custom_eqn = as_eqn(custom_equations))
```

This is what the entire workflow looks like:

```{r}
census_species %>%
  allo_find(custom_eqn = as_eqn(custom_equations)) %>%
  allo_evaluate()
```

### Issues

Our progress is recorded in this [Kanban project board](https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb/projects/4). Because we still don't support some features, the the biomass result currently is invalid and excludes some trees.

Issues that result in invalid biomass:

* We still don't handle units correctly (https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb/issues/42).

Issues that result in data loss:

* The output excludes equations that apply to only part of a tree instead of the whole tree (https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb/issues/63, https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo.biomass/issues/9).

* We exclude equations from shrubs (https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb/issues/41).
