### [Issue](https://github.com/forestgeo/allodb/issues/73)

> We'll want to make the following plot:

> * x-axis: DBH (cm)
> * y-axis: biomass (kg)
> * one colored line or series of points for each species at a site.

Example: plot for SCBI. We want a plot like this except by species -- mapping each species to a color.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1
some_species <- sample(unique(census$sp), 8)

p <- census %>% 
  filter(sp %in% some_species) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dbh, agb, color = sp)) + 
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "SCBI allometries")

p
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
p +
  guides(color = "none") +
  facet_wrap("sp", ncol = 6)
```

### Introduction

Here I plot `dbh` vs `biomass` by species, for the species we can get a meaningful biomass right now. Some species will be left out because fgeo.biomass can't handle them until I we support some additional issues. I still don't wrap the code in an elegant function. I prefer to expose the internals to make the process more transparent during review.

### Data

Drop rows with missing `dbh` values as we can't calculate biomass for them.

```{r}
census <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_tree1 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dbh)) %>% 
  # Sample a few rows for speed
  sample_n(1000)
```

This is unexpected: Some dead trees have non-missing `dbh` values. I do nothing about it and continue.

```{r}
census %>% 
  filter(status == "D") %>% 
  select(dbh, matches("status"))
```

Find allometric equations in allodb and calculate biomass.

```{r}
species <- fgeo.biomass::scbi_species
census_species <- census %>% 
  add_species(species, site = "SCBI")

with_equations <- allo_find(census_species)
biomass <- allo_evaluate(with_equations)
biomass
```

Let's visualize the results. First, lets plot `dbh` vs. `agb`. `agb` comes with the data; it is not what we calculated and it's maybe invalid, but it is can help have a vague idea of what to expect.

```{r}
census_biomass <- left_join(census_species, biomass)

census_biomass %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dbh, agb)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Now let's plot `dbh` vs. `biomass`.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
eqn_biomass <- with_equations %>% right_join(biomass)

eqn_biomass %>% 
  right_join(biomass) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dbh, biomass)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Some values appear to be surprisingly high. 

```{r}
eqn_biomass %>% 
  right_join(biomass) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sp, biomass)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

They seem to all come from the _Nyssa Sylvatica_. Is it's allometric equation correct?

```{r}
eqn_biomass %>% 
  select(sp, equation_id, eqn, dbh, biomass) %>% 
  arrange(desc(biomass))
```

To see more detail on the lower `biomass` values, let's remove that species and plot again.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
eqn_biomass %>% 
  filter(sp != "nyssa sylvatica") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dbh, biomass, color = sp)) +
  geom_point()
```

This is more informative.

---

Some `biomass` values are missing. 

```{r}
failed <- census_species %>% 
  right_join(biomass) %>% 
  filter(is.na(biomass)) %>% 
  select(rowid, site, matches("status"), dbh, sp, biomass)

failed
```

Is this because the corresponding species couldn't be found in allodb? 

```{r}
failed_species <- unique(failed$sp)
all(failed_species %in% tolower(species$Latin))
```

No. Information for these species is available. I need to investigate what's going on.
